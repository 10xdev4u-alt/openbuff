# Scripts

> For maintainers.

## First checkout

OpenBuff uses [Vite+](https://viteplus.dev/guide/). Install the global `vp` command, install
dependencies, then start the dev stack:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vite.plus | bash   # Windows: irm https://vite.plus/ps1 | iex
vp i
vp run dev
```

Node 24 is required. Bun is not: the server picks Bun adapters when it detects Bun and falls back to
Node otherwise, and nothing in contributor setup needs it.

`vp run dev` prints a one-time pairing URL. Open it so the first browser navigation is
authenticated.

## Dev

- `vp run dev`: Starts contracts, server, and web in watch mode.
- `vp run dev --share`: Also publishes the web port over HTTPS on this machine's tailnet. The
  startup pairing URL is built against the shared origin, and the mapping is removed on exit.
  Shared runs default to Vite's bundled dev mode (`T3CODE_BUNDLED_DEV=1`): a remote browser pays a
  network round trip per import level in unbundled dev, which turns a cold module graph into
  minutes of waterfall. Set `T3CODE_BUNDLED_DEV=0` to opt a shared run back out.
- `vp run dev --browser`: Auto-opens a browser. Off by default. The dev runner writes
  `T3CODE_NO_BROWSER` itself from this flag, so setting `T3CODE_NO_BROWSER=0` in your environment has
  no effect; use `--browser`.
- `vp run dev:server`: Starts just the server. It runs on Node (`node --watch src/bin.ts`), so
  without Bun present it selects `NodePtyAdapter` and `NodeHttpServer`.
- `vp run dev:web`: Starts just the Vite dev server for the web app.
- Pass dev-runner flags directly after the root task name, for example:
  `vp run dev --home-dir /tmp/openbuff-dev`

### Dev state directories

- Dev commands run from a linked **git worktree** default to that worktree's gitignored `.t3`, even
  when `T3CODE_HOME` is set, storing state in `<worktree>/.t3/userdata`. Pass `--home-dir <path>` to
  choose another isolated directory explicitly. Submodules are not worktrees and keep the normal
  precedence.
- From the **main checkout**, dev commands implicitly use `~/.t3/dev`, keeping development state
  separate from `~/.t3/userdata`. An explicit `--home-dir <path>` stores state under
  `<path>/userdata`; the base directory remains available for caches, worktrees, and other shared
  data.

## Build, check, test

- `vp run build`: Fans out over `apps/*`, `packages/*`, `oxlint-plugin-t3code`, and `scripts`.
  Workspaces that define a build task run one: server (which depends on web) and web. Shared
  packages are consumed and bundled transitively rather than built separately.
- `vp run start`: Runs the production server (serves the built web app as static files).
- `vp check`: Vite+ format, lint, and type checks. This repo sets `typeCheck: false` in its lint
  options, so workspace type checking runs separately.
- `vp run typecheck`: Strict TypeScript checks for all packages.
- `vp run test`: Runs workspace tests.
- `node apps/server/scripts/t3-sqlite-state.ts <query|exec> --base-dir <path> ...`: Inspects or seeds
  an isolated SQLite database; writes create a private backup first.

## Browser development

`dev` and `dev:web` leave `VITE_HTTP_URL` and `VITE_WS_URL` unset so the browser resolves the backend
from `window.location.origin`. Vite proxies `/api`, `/ws`, `/oauth`, and `/.well-known` to the
server, allowing the same bundle to work from localhost or a tailnet hostname.

## Running multiple dev instances

Worktrees derive a preferred port offset from their path.

- Default ports: server `13773`, web `5733`
- Shifted ports: `base + offset`
- Example: `T3CODE_DEV_INSTANCE=branch-a vp run dev`

Offset resolution, in order:

1. `T3CODE_PORT_OFFSET`, which must be a non-negative integer. Negative values are rejected.
2. `T3CODE_DEV_INSTANCE`. An all-digit value is used directly as the offset; any other non-empty
   value is hashed into one.
3. The worktree path hash.

Collision scanning depends on the mode. `dev:web` scans only the web port and shifts only the web
offset. `dev:server` scans only the server port. `dev` scans both and shifts them together as one
shared offset. Explicit server or dev-URL overrides remove the corresponding port
from the availability check. Treat the `[dev-runner]` output as authoritative.
